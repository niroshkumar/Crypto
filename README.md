1. RSA [RSA_plain_Text_Finding.py] In a public-key system using RSA, you intercept the ciphertext
C = 10 sent to a user whose public key is {e = 5, n = 35}. Show all your work (either Math
or Python) to answer the following two questions (not necessarily in that order):
a) What is the plaintext M? Hint: with n = 35, a brute force may save you headaches.
b) What is the secret exponent d in the private key {d = ?, n = 35}?

2. Key Exchange [Diffie_Hellman_Key_Exchange.py]. In a Diffie-Hellman scheme with a common prime q =
11 and a primitive root α = 2:
a) If user A has public key YA = 9, what is A’s private key X?
b) If user B has public key YB = 3, what is the secret key K, shared with A?
